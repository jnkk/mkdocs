# What is [selfhosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/)

Simply is "cloud computing" in our own network/house.

[Selfhost apps](https://selfh.st/apps/) is a great tool for discovering what to install.

## Where to start?

Old computers or laptops are a great start, since they are cheap or even free, if you have an unused computer hardware.
Or a "specialized" used office hardware that is relatively cheap.
Currently using an old Intel 4th gen 4010U that released on Q3 2013.

Using [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com) only using [LXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC), I can have more services than my CPU cores allow, with some albeit minor delay.
