# Hopes and dreams  

Build a homelab for learning a lot of stuff, adding CCTV, and the most important thing a NAS.
Storage is really important for the modern era. For now cloud services like Google Cloud and right now, Github.  
My code is saved there, I hope.  

The ultamite goal is a smart home system with automation.

In dire need of a new pc. 8 core, 16 threads with a minimum of 32 GBs of RAM and 16 GBs of VRAM like the Radeon 7600 XT. So I can run [ollama](https://ollama.com/)/LLMs locally using [continuedev](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) inside VSCode. Playing around with local LLMs right now can be an advatage in the future where it is everywhere.
Local agentic LLMs using programs like [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) might be helpful for local "AI helpers".

The component list inside
[Proxmox Server](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/qqnKPF)
is "ideal" for starters, maybe overkill for beginners LMAO.
