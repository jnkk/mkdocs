```

/speckit.constitution Update the constitution. Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements. Include governance for how these principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices. The AGENTS.md file is the source of truth.


## /speckit.specify Example:
```markdown
/speckit.specify Develop Garis Miring, website for helping humans in the world of AI. Users can post their services (example cleaning, repairs), make an admin page to add, remove or update existing services. Make a category for availabe services, for home, apartements or offices. This is dual language website for now, Indonesian as the default and has an English site. The code implementation is in English.  



It should allow users to create custom PC builds, allow the admin (me, the project owner. Use the `usage rules` for further information) page (it does not have to be in the `/admin` route. It can be in `/web_admin`) to add and remove computer components and their compatibilities with ease with a yaml file (like a seed.ex), also allow the admin make a build and build templetes so other users can later buy (using affiliate links. Provide later in the project), allow users to comment on the builds that other users or the admin has built, allow users to orovide feedback and able to take surveys from the admin. 
```

## /speckit.plan Example:
```markdown
We are already inside an Ash and Phoenix Framework so we are using the Elixir programming language. Use the default Postgres from Phoenix Framework as the database. The frontend should use liveview with tailwindcss, use liveview whenever possible for real-time updates. Use the tidewave MCP for further information about the server logs (whenever the compile success. Cannot run the server if the project cannot compile). 
```
